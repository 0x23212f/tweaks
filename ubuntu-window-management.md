# Ubuntu Window Management
It's a huge annoyance to have a serious programming workflow disrupted by the need to move, resize and fix your application windows.

I have multiple instances of vim, some of sublime text, a few terminals, intellij idea, a browser, a file manager etc all running at the same time to fulfil my workflow.

I confess. I might have gotten a little excessively attached to i3wm.
### What to do?

Well, our luck hasn't run out. It seems it is possible to have something similar to a *non-automatic* window tiling system on Unity.

You need to get **compizconfig-settings-manager**.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
```

Then you need to run it.

```sh
$ ccsm
```

### Now what?

Navigate to: Window Management > Grid

Configure to your convenience, and chill.
